This project is a basic implementation of Minesweeper using C++ and SDL2. It focuses on core mechanics such as tile opening and flagging, with a minimal graphics interface for simplicity. The goal is to demonstrate fundamental principles of interactive application development using C++ and a lightweight graphics library.
